## Motive

Gertrude Stein published _Tender Buttons_ in 1914 and, since then, I imagine generations of writers have enjoyed and struggled with her work. We readers are thrust into the thick of a world re-imagined, or re-examined, with the impelling "The difference is spreading" that ends the first poem:

> A CARAFE, THAT IS A BLIND GLASS.
> 
> A kind in glass and a cousin, a spectacle and nothing strange a single hurt color and an arrangement in a system to pointing. All this and not ordinary, not unordered in not resembling. The difference is spreading.

My own powers of observation and imagination cannot compare with Gertrude Stein's. But to show that I care, and to grow as a reader and writer, this is my poem-by-poem explication of all the objects in _Tender Buttons_.
