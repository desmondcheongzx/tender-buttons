## Glitter

> GLAZED GLITTER.
>
> Nickel, what is nickel, it is originally rid of a cover.
>
> The change in that is that red weakens an hour. The change has come. There is no search. But there is, there is that hope and that interpretation and sometime, surely any is unwelcome, sometime there is breath and there will be a sinecure and charming very charming is that clean and cleansing. Certainly glittering is handsome and convincing.
>
> There is no gratitude in mercy and in medicine. There can be breakages in Japanese. That is no programme. That is no color chosen. It was chosen yesterday, that showed spitting and perhaps washing and polishing. It certainly showed no obligation and perhaps if borrowing is not natural there is some use in giving.

### Definitions

Sinecure: a position requiring little or no work but giving the holder status or financial benefit.

Originally referring to an office in the medieval church without responsibility for the care of souls. From Latin _sine_ "without" + _cura_ "care". Sans and cure.

### Sounds

Glazed, glitter. The l, wedded to the front with a g, travels to the back in nickel, and is emasculated in the adverb of "originally".

At the middle: charming, clean, and cleansing. Certainly; convincing.

Throughout: "what is", "it is", "The change", "The change", "There is", "But there is", "there is", "surely any", "sometime there is", "and there will be", "Certainly", "There is", "There can be", "That is no", "That is no", "It was", "It certainly", "there is".

### Rhymes

Rhymes seem to be clearer near the start of the poems (or maybe that's when I have the most energy). "cover" and "hour".

The "ri" in "originally" and "rid".

"rid" and "red".

The "ti"/"di" in "gratitude" and "medicine", both three syllable, both hiding the upward inflection in their middles.

"mercy" and "medicine".

What if there were a single additional "yen" added to the back of Japanese. We would have "medicine", "yen", "programme", "chosen", "chosen". Not quite rhymes, but close cousins. It may be implied in the spaces.

### Meditations

Nickels --- as in the coin --- are often composed partly of nickel --- as in the chemical element. And in their natural forms out in the wild, they are bare of the icon that humans tend to stamp upon their covers.

The process of minting these nickels is a red-hot change that weakens the bonds between atoms. It takes time. How much? I do not know; perhaps an hour.

Through change, the metal becomes monetary change - and that's what all currency is; nothing more than a placeholder that one uses to exchange some goods for other goods. Money is hope, a wish that you may receive something in the future. When we hold money in our hands, we hold only hope. And the exchange of hope for substance is subject to interpretation, to the relative valuing between offerings.

We are only convinced to hope in these circular cut-outs of metal because they glitter and are thus handsome. The more glittery, the more certain we are.

A coin is a sinecure. It does nothing, indeed it mustn't do anything. Coins are inert, and gold is so treasured because it is a lazy and glittering metal. The useless coin, which cares nothing for my soul, confers financial benefit. Ironically, it is neither clean nor cleansing, both physically and spiritually.

---

But why does a coin breathe? And why is this unwelcome? I cannot say, but in any case it would not be welcome so it must be unwelcome.

---

You do not feel gratitude when you donate, nor when you pay to recover from an accident. Mercy and medicine conjure an image of a broken person, and we transfer that breakage to Japanese - where the Japanese yen may have a hole in them.

---

Money needs no color. It only needs to glitter. So this glittering color of money might be gotten from, spit, from washing and polishing it with the spit.

---

Borrowing and giving go back to the idea of money. It is hard to borrow, because you become obliged to the lender. But if something is given, there is no obligation.

### Connections

The glittering coin connects us to the [carafe](/objects/carafe); it is the change following the difference which is spreading. It also connects us to the [cushion](/objects/cushion) - a space where nickels and other ephemera tend to gather. "There is no search", for you already know where the coin will end up.
